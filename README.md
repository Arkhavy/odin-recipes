# TheOdinProject

## foundations-recipes

As asked in the introduction of [the project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes), the website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes, with the goal to build a basic recipe website.

The first part and first few commits will mostly be only HTML since CSS has not been mentioned yet in the curriculum, but this project will be revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.
