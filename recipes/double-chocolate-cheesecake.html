	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>Cheesecake is a dessert made with a soft fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese, quark or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. It may have a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.</p>
	<p>This time is a double cheesecake, a combination of baked cheesecake and cheese cream. The base is a baked cheesecake that's close to the Basque cheesecake but softer then topped with Mascarpone cream.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>13 creme-filled chocolate sandwich cookies, crushed, plus more for garnish</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
		<li>10 ounces dark chocolate, chopped</li>
		<li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted</li>
		<li>1/4 cup hot water</li>
		<li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
		<li>1 cup white sugar</li>
		<li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Line bottom of an 8- or 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. Stir cookie crumbs and melted butter together in a small microwave-safe bowl. Press crumb mixture into bottom of the prepared pan. Chill crust while preparing filling. Wipe out bowl.</li>
		<li>Microwave chocolate in same bowl on High, stirring every 15 seconds, until melted, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, whisk cocoa powder and hot water together in a bowl until smooth. Add cream cheese and sugar. Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed until well combined. Fold in cooled melted chocolate.</li>
		<li>In a large bowl, beat cream with an electric mixer at medium speed until soft peaks form. Fold in chocolate-cream cheese mixture until well combined; spoon into chilled crust, spreading evenly.</li>
		<li>Chill, covered, at least 4 hours or up to 1 week before serving. Garnish with additional cookies.</li>
