	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>Pound cake refers to a type of cake traditionally made with a pound of each of four ingredients: flour, butter, eggs, and sugar. The traditional recipe makes a cake much larger than most families can consume, and so the quantity is often changed to suit the size of the cake that is desired.</p>
	<p>Lemon cake is a dense, flavorful and very popular cake. Lemon is used to provide its unique flavor to a variety of cakes, including bundt, angel food or white cakes. However, lemon cake commonly refers to loaf cake with a tighter grain and more elastic crumb, much like a pound cake.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>2 cups white sugar</li>
		<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>5 eggs</li>
		<li>1 cup shortening (such as Crisco®)</li>
		<li>5 tablespoons whole milk</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons lemon extract</li>
		<li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans.</li>
		<li>Combine sugar, flour, eggs, shortening, whole milk, vanilla extract, lemon extract, and baking powder in a large bowl; pour into the prepared pans.</li>
		<li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes.</li>
