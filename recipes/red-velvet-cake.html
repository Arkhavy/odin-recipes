	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>Red velvet cake is a classic and beloved dessert with a striking crimson hue and fluffy texture. Originating from a tradition that blends both art and science, this cake marries the subtle flavors of cocoa and vanilla that evoke a sense of nostalgia and mystery.</p>
	<p>It is different from chocolate cake because of a chemical reaction between the vinegar and buttermilk used to make red velvet cakes! Not only does the reaction heighten the red color of the cake, but it makes the cake extra moist, fluffy and light.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>

	<h3>Cake</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
		<li>½ cup shortening</li>
		<li>2 eggs</li>
		<li>4 tablespoons red food coloring</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons cocoa</li>
		<li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
		<li>2 ½ cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
		<li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Icing</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>1 cup milk</li>
		<li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>1 cup white sugar</li>
		<li>1 cup butter, room temperature</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round pans.</li>
		<li>Make the cake: Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and shortening together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine red food coloring and cocoa to make a paste; add to creamed mixture.</li>
		<li>Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a small bowl. Add flour, alternating with buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated.</li>
		<li>Mix vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and pour into prepared pans.</li>
		<li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
		<li>Make the icing: Heat milk and flour in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick. Set aside to cool completely.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency. Frost cake layers when completely cool.</li>
